## 2025-01-31 - first meeting with group mates

Objective: discuss and flesh out the bike lock project

First meeting with group mates, we discussed ideas for the bike lock project, we ended up settling first making a minimal viable product and not being too overly ambitious. We are going to make a bike lock with a digital app of some kind that can operate the lock remotely and access a log of events.
